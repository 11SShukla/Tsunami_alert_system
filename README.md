# Tsunami Risk Prediction System

This project develops a machine learning-based system to predict tsunami risk levels for three states, categorizing them into low, moderate, and high risk. By analyzing relevant data, the system aims to provide early warnings and support disaster preparedness efforts.

**Overview:**

The system employs a Lightgbm ML algorithm  to analyze data and predict the likelihood of a tsunami. The risk is classified into three levels:

* **Low Risk:** Minimal probability of a tsunami.
* **Moderate Risk:** Potential for a tsunami event.
* **High Risk:** Significant likelihood of a tsunami.



**Potential Applications:**

* Early warning systems.
* Disaster preparedness.
* Risk assessment.

**Future Enhancements:**

* Real-time data integration.
* Improved accuracy.
* Expand to more states.
