# Tsunami Risk Prediction System

This project develops a machine learning-based system to predict tsunami risk levels for three states, categorizing them into low, moderate, and high risk. By analyzing relevant data, the system aims to provide early warnings and support disaster preparedness efforts.

**Overview:**

The system employs a [Specify the ML algorithm used, e.g., classification algorithm like Random Forest, SVM, or a custom model] to analyze data and predict the likelihood of a tsunami. The risk is classified into three levels:

* **Low Risk:** Minimal probability of a tsunami.
* **Moderate Risk:** Potential for a tsunami event.
* **High Risk:** Significant likelihood of a tsunami.

**Key Features:**

* **Machine Learning Prediction:** Utilizes [Specify the ML algorithm used] for risk assessment.
* **Three Risk Levels:** Categorizes risk into low, moderate, and high.
* **State-Specific Predictions:** Provides predictions for three states [Mention the states if comfortable].
* **Data-Driven Analysis:** Leverages [Mention data sources, e.g., historical tsunami data, seismic activity, oceanographic data].

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* [Add any other relevant libraries]

**How to Use:**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run `predict_tsunami.py` with input data.
4.  Interpret output as low, moderate, or high risk.

**Potential Applications:**

* Early warning systems.
* Disaster preparedness.
* Risk assessment.

**Future Enhancements:**

* Real-time data integration.
* Improved accuracy.
* Expand to more states.
